      <h5>George Washington</h5>
          Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family, he learned the morals, manners, 
          and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman.

          He pursued two intertwined interests: military arts and western expansion.
          At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas, Lord Fairfax. 
          Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754, 
          he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War.
          The next year, as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, 
          he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him.
          Washington enjoyed less than three years of retirement at Mount Vernon,
          for he died of a throat infection December 14, 1799. For months the Nation mourned him.
